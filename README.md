# flightsearch
Small application to search flights between source and destination
## to get the search flights result, pick a date in februaury

## Here, I impelemented Flight search functionality in ReactJS. a form, where user can input and search for the flights. Then user will be able to see the search results, user can refine the search using a slider for prices.

### FlightJson.js => required data for few flights, more json data can be added in this file or replace this file with another file.
### App.scss => all styles used search engine
### App.css => generated styles bundle
### DateTimePicker => used react-widget for DateTimePicker

### index.js => root component calls when project starts
